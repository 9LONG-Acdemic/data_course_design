# Curriculum Innovator: Mastering Data Science & AI through Market-Driven Course Design 

## Project Description

This project focuses on redesigning the data science and artificial intelligence curriculum by analyzing current job market demands. Through a comprehensive study of required skills and roles in the industry, the project aims to identify gaps in existing educational offerings and develop a curriculum that prepares students for future challenges in data science and AI fields. The methodology of this project is a combination of text analytics, natural language processing, generative AI (e.g. GPT-4), and clustering algorithms (Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering). The goal is to bridge the gap between academic preparation and industry needs, ensuring graduates are well-equipped with the relevant skills and knowledge to thrive in their careers.
